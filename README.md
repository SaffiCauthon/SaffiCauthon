# A Bit About Me:
Hi, I'm Saffi Cauthon!

Hopefully you've found this account in good will, it is a private account to be used for Runescape & Old School Runescape purposes.

If I’m not helping with TempleOSRS you will find me hanging around in various Discord servers, or playing in some semi-efficient manner.

I am one of the few administrators and developers for TempleOSRS & EHP. Besides this I’m a member of Totus, and The Summit.

I like helping where I can, and documenting my knowledge for others to learn.
