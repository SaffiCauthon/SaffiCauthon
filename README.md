# A Bit About Me:
Hi, I'm Saffi Cauthon!

Hopefully you've found this account in good will, it is a private account to be used for Runescape & Old School Runescape purposes.

If I’m not helping with TempleOSRS you will find me hanging around in various Discord servers, or playing in some semi-efficient manner.

I am one of the few administrators and curators for TempleOSRS & EHP, as well as as a lead administrator for the Volcanic Mine discord. Besides this I’m a staff member in Omnia, a member of Totus, and a member of The Summit.

I like helping where I can, and documenting my knowledge for others to learn
